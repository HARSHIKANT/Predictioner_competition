Project Report: Predictive Modeling for Health Metrics
Using Geographical Data
1. Introduction
This project aims to explore the predictive potential of geographical data (latitude and
longitude) in forecasting critical health metrics during a hypothetical health crisis. The
primary objectives are:
● Predicting Deaths: Estimating the number of fatalities in a given region using
geographical and contextual data.
● Predicting Case Fatality Ratio (CFR): Estimating the proportion of confirmed cases
that result in fatalities.
The project was executed in two phases:
1. Phase 1: Develop a model to predict the number of deaths (Deaths) using
geographical features (Lat, Long_) and known case fatality ratio (CFR).
2. Phase 2: Build a multi-output model to predict both Deaths and CFR simultaneously,
leveraging predictions from Phase 1 for enhanced accuracy.
