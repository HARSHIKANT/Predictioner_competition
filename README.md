1. Introduction:


This project aims to explore the predictive potential of geographical data (latitude and
longitude) in forecasting critical health metrics during a hypothetical health crisis. The
primary objectives are:


● Predicting Deaths: Estimating the number of fatalities in a given region using
geographical and contextual data.


● Predicting Case Fatality Ratio (CFR): Estimating the proportion of confirmed cases
that result in fatalities.


The project was executed in two phases:


1. Phase 1: 
Develop a model to predict the number of deaths (Deaths) using
geographical features (Lat, Long_) and known case fatality ratio (CFR).


2. Phase 2:
 Build a multi-output model to predict both Deaths and CFR simultaneously,
leveraging predictions from Phase 1 for enhanced accuracy.
